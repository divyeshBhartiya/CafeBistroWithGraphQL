Product Table and related code is just for basic implementation. The real project implementation would not involve this implementation and should be ignored. The real project have the real world scenario of Menu > Sub Menu and Reservation.

The project uses Graphiql for accessing GraphQL Endpoints. This repo is under work in progess as it does not have implementation for subscriptions.
